# Neural-Network-Practice
In an effort to familiarize myself with Neural Networks, I setup a tensorflow enviroment on my computer to best optomize any dataset I can find.

This file serves as an attempt to get as high enough accuracy using a simple neural network, no CNNs or pools (yet). This mode ended up getting a 70 percent accuracy, which is very good.
This is great because the model only struggles to tell the difference between a dog and a cat, everything else seems find otherwise.
